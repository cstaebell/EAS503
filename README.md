# Data Science Portfolio
## Renewable Energy Perspectives
Global electricity data was sourced from Ember for this exercise in data-driven storytelling. Data was manipulated and visualized using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. An accompanying writeup places the analysis within the context of current events and discusses key insights gained from data exploration. 

## Coffee Shop Sales
Python visualizations and SQL queries (SQLite) were leveraged to gain operational insights for a simulated coffee shop sales dataset. A companion article discusses the findings and their significance for our fictitious coffee shop. 

## Income Dataset Neural Network
The Income dataset contains demographic and income data for individuals. After preprocessing, a two layer neural network was built using Keras to predict income group (> $50,000 or <= $50,000). This relatively simple model achieved 85.38% testing accuracy.

## Fashion MNIST Convolutional Neural Network
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains labeled images of wardrobe items. The dataset is split into test and training sets. The training dataset has 60,000 28 x 28 grayscale images and the test set has 10,000 28 x 28 images. Each pixel can take on values from 0 to 255. Each image is labeled with an integer value 0 to 9 corresponding to a class. Keras was used to build a basic CNN with two hidden layers to classify the images in the training set. The CNN achieved a testing accuracy of 92.7% and a training accuracy of 94.2%.

## Wine Quality: Predictive Performance of Logistic Regression vs. Neural Network
This project was implemented in R with the goal of predicting wines with a quality rating of 7 or higher based on 11 chemical predictors. The performance of a neural network was compared against a logistic regression model. Both models achieved similar predictive accuracies, around 87%. In this case, the logistic regression model is preferred since it is simpler to implement and interpret.
